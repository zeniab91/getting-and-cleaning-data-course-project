This code book includes information about the data used in this project, as well as steps to re-create the tidy data set.

Overview
30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone, which captured their movements.

Each file in the getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip folder contains the following .txt files:

- activity_labels.txt: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

- features.txt: Names of the 561 features.

- X_train.txt: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.

- subject_train.txt: A column of 7352 integers, indicating the volunteer ID related to each observation in X_train.txt.

- y_train.txt: A column of 7352 integers, indicating the activity ID related to each observation in X_train.txt.

- X_test.txt: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.

- subject_test.txt: A column of 2947 integers, indicating the volunteer ID related to each observation in X_test.txt.

- y_test.txt: A column of 2947 integers, indicating the activity ID related to each observation in X_test.txt.



README.txt contains more information about the files. The features_info.txt file contains more information about the features.

Only the files listed above were necessary to perform this analysis. The files in the "Inertial Signals" folders were not used.

Processing steps
1) The data files listed above were read into data frames, column headers were added, and the training and test sets were combined into a single data set.
2) The data set was edited to remove feature columns that did not contain the exact string "mean()" or "std()". This left 66 columns, plus the subjectID and activity columns.
3) The activity column was converted to a factor, using labels to describe each activity.
4) A tidy data set was created containing the mean of each feature, listed by subject and by activity. 
- Each subject (30 subjects) has a row for each activity (6 activites), for a total of 180 rows.
- Each cell contains the mean value for each feature (66 features) for that subject/activity. Each column indicates a different feature.
5) The tidy data set was output to a CSV file, tidy.csv.
